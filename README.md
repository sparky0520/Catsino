# Catsino

### Catsino project made during E-Cell DTU Hackathon by Team Titans

Our project is aimed at increasing the low retention rate of online and offline casinos by providing players with rewards based on tokens they earn from playing more games.

Our project uses the Diamante Blockchain and ReactJS for frontend

The average retention rate for offline casinos is between 25-50% and for online ones it is between 20-40%. Online gambling market is a highly competetive sector but is plagued with such low retention rates.

### To fix this,
- We have created a custom asset namely "MeowTokens" players earn from playing games.
- You can redeem these tokens as some portion of your wager (not exceeding 5% of total wager) in your next game. 
- This will give incentive to players to play more games to redeem these tokens.
- Created a pool jackpot system which increases as every game passes.
- Implemented anti addiction policies due to which you cannnot stake more than 20% of your wallet balance (at the start of the day) in a day.

With these and constant iteration we aim to create a potentially sector disrupting platform for casino players.
